            Graphics cards are an important component of a computer, as they are responsible for rendering and displaying the
            images on the screen. While high-end graphics cards can be expensive, there are also many options for those looking
            for cheap graphics cards. Here are some factors to consider when looking for cheap graphics cards:
            <br />
            <br />
            1. Performance: Cheap graphics cards may not offer the same level of performance as more expensive options. This can
            be particularly noticeable for tasks that require a lot of graphics processing, such as gaming or video editing.
            <br />
            <br />

            2. Compatibility: It is important to ensure that the graphics card is compatible with your computer's hardware and
            software. This includes checking that it is the correct size, has the necessary connectors, and is compatible with
            your operating system.
            <br />
            <br />
            3. Brand: Some brands may offer lower-priced graphics cards that are still of good quality. It is a good idea to do
            some research and read reviews before making a purchase to ensure that you are getting a good value for your money.
            <br />
            <br />
            4. Refurbished: Another option for finding cheap graphics cards is to look for refurbished models. These are used
            cards that have been repaired or reconditioned, and they can offer a good value for the price.
            <br />
            <br />
            When looking for the best cheap graphics card under $250, there are several options to consider. One option is the
            NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650. This card is suitable for 1080p gaming and is capable of handling most modern games at high
            settings. It is also energy efficient, making it a good choice for those looking to save on power costs.
            <br />
            <br />
            Another option is the AMD Radeon RX 570. This card is also suitable for 1080p gaming and offers good value for the
            price. It is a bit more powerful than the GTX 1650, but may also be slightly more expensive.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is worth noting that while cheap graphics cards may not offer the same level of performance as more expensive
            options, they can still be suitable for basic tasks such as web browsing, office applications, and casual gaming.
            <br />
            <br />
            In summary, there are many options for those looking for cheap graphics cards, but it is important to consider factors
            such as performance, compatibility, and brand when making a purchase. The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 and the AMD Radeon
            RX 570 are both good options for those looking for a cheap graphics card under $250.
